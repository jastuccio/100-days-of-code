### R1D1: Sept 18, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:

- Started building a personal site using Gatsby Starter Blog @React @GatsbyJs
- Listened to @syntax.fm
- wrote a little JavaScript to calculate the percent of the year that has passed. This will be an additional feature for the random quote machine

**Thoughts**
Learning on React, Gatsby, and CSS Grid right now.

**Link(s) to work**
I haven't pushed the new site up to @Netlify yet.
